# IP-TASK
Image Processing on a Raspberry Pi connected to external camera (of course). It uses colour filters to isolate and identify a ball with a specific colour. 

This has been tested indoors with a blue coloured ball. This code was a part of Team Rudra's effort to compete in the 2019 URC at Utah, USA.
